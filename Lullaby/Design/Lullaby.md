### ** Game Concept **
The player must find their way to safety from being locked outside in a cold winter with barely any cover. It will be strictly time based. As a 10 year old, you must try to survive. But how would a 10 year old survive the winter without getting hypothermia.

This game should be very hard.

### ** Target Audience **
This should be family friendly despite harsh reality.

### ** Look and Feel **

This should have a wintery feel in the mountains where the temperature is -60 F and winds are blowing the snow in your face.

### ** Gameplay **

** Objective **
	The player needs to become warm again. Explore the map to find warmth, but you don't have much time left.

** Challenge Structure **
	The player has 10 minutes until they fall into hypothermia.

### ** Movement **

-   3D Controller

-   Sprinting can happen if the player presses Shift. Sprinting only lasts for 10 seconds. Then must wait 30 seconds to sprint again. A bar below the player would count down the time you are sprinting  and when you can sprint again. The bar would disappear after 5 seconds no matter what state it’s in after button press. But it stays on screen while sprinting. You cannot sprint if you have hypothermia.

### ** Timed Events **
- If you stay at the road, there will be twice a car would come up to you and save you. But there's another chance where a car would come and save you to hurt you. 
- A Bear comes out of nowhere and attacks you
- If you stand in a certain spot at a certain time, someone will rescue you.

### ** Features **

** Bathroom System **
		- After 1 minutes, this system turns on.
		- Every time the meter gets full, you need to hurry and find somewhere to pee
		- Every time you pee, the timer goes down 20 seconds.


** Hypothermia System **
		- This happens when the clock reaches 5 minutes.
		- This is kinda like desparate mode
		- The player's walkspeed gets slow
		- The scenery gets confusing
		- And the urgency to find people becomes more apparent

** Fire system **
		- The player can find a lighter and a bunch of used cigarettes inside an abandoned shed. 
		- Player must think to light something on fire.
		- Things that can be light on fire: Her teddy bear, Paper (Only in shelter), Wood (Only in shelter)

** Inventory **
		- Player can only carry 2 things. One slot is occupied with the teddy bear, so you have the other slot for many other things.
		- They can only let go of their teddy bear if the player finds shelter
		- You can drop things in the game, but not by choice. Well by choice too but there's a randomization of dropping items. But you will never drop your teddy bear.
		- After 3 minutes, you can't hold onto anything anymore (Except teddy bear). Shelter is needed.

** Timer **
		- Timer starts at 10 minutes
		- Hypothermia System starts at 5 minutes
		- Bathroom system starts at 9 minutes

** Shelter Areas **
		- There will be a few shelter areas.
		- Some shelter areas would add time, some would deplete time
		- You can make a fire in the shelter area only if you have a lighter and the shelter isn't a bad one.
		- There are good, bad, and cave shelter areas. 
		- Good shelter areas are areas where the cold isn't as bad
		- Bad shelter areas are where the cold is apparent
		- Cave shelter areas are a combination of good and bad. Chances that you could run into a sleeping bear is high. So it's not advised to go deeper into a cave.
